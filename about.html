                <p>Research on offline signature verification has explored a large variety of methods on multiple
                    signature datasets, which are collected under controlled conditions. However, these datasets may not
                    fully reflect the characteristics of the signatures in some practical use cases. Real-world
                    signatures extracted from the formal documents may contain different types of occlusions, for
                    example, stamps, company seals, ruling lines, and signature boxes. Moreover, they may have very high
                    intra-class variations, where even genuine signatures resemble forgeries. In this paper, we address
                    a real-world writer independent offline signature verification problem, in which, a bank's
                    customers' transaction request documents that contain their occluded signatures are compared with
                    their clean reference signatures. Our proposed method consists of two main components, a stamp
                    cleaning method based on CycleGAN and signature representation based on CNNs. We extensively
                    evaluate different verification setups, fine-tuning strategies, and signature representation
                    approaches to have a thorough analysis of the problem. Moreover, we conduct a human evaluation to
                    show the challenging nature of the problem. We run experiments both on our custom dataset, as well
                    as on the publicly available Tobacco-800 dataset. The experimental results validate the difficulty
                    of offline signature verification on real-world documents. However, by employing the stamp cleaning
                    process, we improve the signature verification performance significantly.

                <h3>Setting up digital signature validation</h3>
                <p>When you receive a signed document, you may want to validate its signature(s) to verify the signer
                    and the signed content. Depending on how you have configured your application, validation may occur
                    automatically. Signature validity is determined by checking the authenticity of the signature’s
                    digital ID certificate status and document integrity:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Authenticity verification confirms that the signer's certificate or its parent certificates
                        exist in the validator’s list of trusted identities. It also confirms whether the signing
                        certificate is valid based on the user's Acrobat or Reader configuration.</li>
                    <li>Document integrity verification confirms whether the signed content changed after it was signed.
                        If content changes, document integrity verification confirms whether the content changed in a
                        manner permitted by the signer.</li>
                </ul>

                    <h3>What We Do</h3>
                    <p>We do this by reversing the digital signing process - we take the document that you upload and
                        using
                        an algorithm calculate a hash value of the data. We then extract the hash value from the digital
                        signature using the public key of the person’s digital signature. If the two hash values match
                        then
                        we know the signature is valid and the document has not been altered. If they don't match we
                        consider the digital signature invalid and it either means that a different key was used to sign
                        it,
                        or that the data has been altered (either intentionally or unintentionally).
